# Code Refactor

## Description 

In this repository ("Code Refactor"), I have inlcuded the otimized code of a sample marketing agency website as part of my first assignment for UofT SCS Coding Boot Camp Course. The sample marketing agency website code provided as been improved and optimized for web accesibilty, without changing what it does. 

As we all know, Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible to all is should be core responsibility of web developers.
This source code is available to everyone under the standard MIT license.
